You can find here all the databases that I used in my work :
- The folder "Runways" includes the program with all the needed documents to build the Runway database.
- "Country_Codes.txt" is the list of ICAO member states with their ISO Codes.
- The World Bank Income Classification (the two last documents in "txt" & "xlsx") is given from 2003 to 2018 (it can be easily found on the World Bank website).
