In this folder, you have three kinds of documents :
- A database with only the number of Runways by Airport (called "Runways" in ".txt" or '.xlsx").
- "Rwys.json" with the layout of Runways for some Airports and the needed expansion with "Rwys_Additional.json". The second file only include the Airports missing in "Rwys.json" with more than one Runway, because the layout isn't meaningful for the Airports with a single Runway.
