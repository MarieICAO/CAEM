You can find here my results in the form of Maps :

-> "Country_Capacity" designates the first classification (by Number of Major Airports, Maximum Number of Runaways by Airports & Number of National Airlines).

-> "Country_Traffic_Flow" designated the second classification (by Number of Big, Average & Small Airports).

-> "Country_Final_Income" designated the final classification, which is a merger of the two previous one.
