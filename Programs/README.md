You can find all the needed programs to reproduce my work :

-> "Database.py" is the module of the categorization, i.e. it contains all the needed functions to execute the action in the following programs. 

-> The other three are the programs wich produce the excel documents needed to build the classifcations.

If you download the files, you must check that they are all in the same folder (otherwise Python might not find the needed module for the programs).
