 Categorization of World Countries according Civil Aviation Facilities

You can find in this repository the needed document to understand and reproduce my classification of countries for the ICAO :
     -> The "Data" branch contains all the needed database for this work, i.e. the - World Bank Classement of 2018 -, the - Countries with their ISO Codes -, the - Number of Runaways by Airports - and the (compressed) - OAG2018 -.
     -> The "Program" branch contains all the needed programs to create the final excel documents, with the relative function in the Database module (if you download them on your computer, be sÃ»r of recording them in the same file in order Python to find the module).
     -> The "Results" branch contains the maps of each categorization and the presentation of my work (the maps are in a subbranch).
     -> Finally, the "Master" branch contains the explanations of my work and the conventions used in my work.
